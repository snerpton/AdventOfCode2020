# Advent of Code 2020

More information about Advent of Code can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020.



## My Aims for Advent of Code 2020

- Use .Net 5 / and latest versions of C#
- Use Visual Studio for Mac and Rider
- TDD with `decent` code coverage
- No external libraries to solve problem... allowed NUnit and Moq for testing



## Project Notes

- Taking a break on a tropical island
- Island is cash only
- Local currency is 'Starfish', often abbreviated to 'stars'
- No currency exchanges deal in stars, so only way to obtain enough stars for deposit is to solve puzzles
- Need 50 stars to pay for room deposit in 25 days time
- Two puzzles per day, with each puzzle paying 1 star



## Day 1

- Elves need me to fix my 'expense report' (puzzle input) before leaving on vacation
- Requirement: need to find the two entries that sum to 2020, and then multiply them together. This number is what we are looking for.
- Example: in list:

  - 1721
  - 979
  - 366
  - 299
  - 675
  - 1456

  Answer would be 514579 as (1721 + 299) = 2020 and (1721 x 299) = 514579
  


## Day 2

- Password database corrupted
- List of password provided in following format:

  - 1-3 a: abcde
  - 1-3 b: cdefg
  - 2-9 c: ccccccccc
  
  where the row is made up of a password policy and password delimited my a `:` character. A policy of `1-3 a` indicates `a` must be used 1-3 times in the password. The first and last passwords are valid, but the second one isn't valid as `b` doesn't occur 1-3 times in `cdefg`.
  
 - Requirement: How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
 
 
 
 ### Part 2
 
 - Requirement: password policy of part 1 incorrect, numbers describe positions not occurrence count, such that:
   - `1-3 a: abcde` is valid: position 1 contains a and position 3 does not.
   - `1-3 b: cdefg` is invalid: neither position 1 nor position 3 contains b.
   - `2-9 c: ccccccccc` is invalid: both position 2 and position 9 contain c.
   
   Exactly one of these positions must contain the specified letter.
  
   
   
 ## Day 3
 
 - Puzzle input is a map of trees where `.` represents open space, and `#` represents a tree.
 - Trees grow on a grid pattern.
 - Pattern repeats horizontally.
 - Navigate from top-left to off bottom of map in a move right 3 places and down 1. In this way you navigate diagonally downward.
 - Aim of puzzle is to count the number of trees you stop on i.e. after the 3-right 1-down move.
 
 
 
 ## Day 4
 
 - Passprts have following fields:
   
   - byr (Birth Year)
   - iyr (Issue Year)
   - eyr (Expiration Year)
   - hgt (Height)
   - hcl (Hair Color)
   - ecl (Eye Color)
   - pid (Passport ID)
   - cid (Country ID)
   
 - North Pole Credentials are the same as a passport, but without the `cid` field.
 - Scanner processes passports in batch files (puzzle input).
 - Passport made up of `key:value` pairs separated by spaces or new lines. Passports are separated by new lines.
 - Example batch file:
   ```
   ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
   byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm
   
   iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
   hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929
   
   hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
   eyr:2024
   ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
   hgt:179cm
   
   hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
   iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in 
   ```
   where: 
   
   - passport 1 is valid as all fields are present
   - passport 2 is invalid as `hgt` field is missing
   - passport 3 is in valid as `cid` filed is missing
   - passport 4 is invalid as `cid` and `byr` fields missing.
   
 - As a one-off we should also treat the `cid` as optional, and hence allow North Pole Credentials to be used like a passport i.e passport 3 should be treated as apassport even though it is a North Pole Credential
 - Requirement: how many passports are valid there? 
 
 
 
## Day 5
 
- Your airline you are using to fly to the tropical island identifies your seat using a `binary space partition` map where:

  - `F` indicates front
  - `B` indicates back
  - `L` indicates left
  - `R` indicates
  
 - First 7 characters of your sead number will be either `F` or `B`, and the final 3 `L` or `R` where:
 
   - `L` indicates left
   - `R` indicates right
   
 - First 7 characters describe which row of 0- 128 you are in.
 - Last 3 characters describe which column of 0-7 you are in.
 - Seat ID is calculated by (row x 8 + col)
 - Example boarding passes are:
 
 Here are some other boarding passes:
 
   - `FBFBBFFRLR`: row 44, column 5, seat ID (44 * 8 + 5) = 357
   - `BFFFBBFRRR`: row 70, column 7, seat ID 567.
   - `FFFBBBFRRR`: row 14, column 7, seat ID 119.
   - `BBFFBBFRLL`: row 102, column 4, seat ID 820.
 
 - Requirement: What is the highest seat ID on a boarding pass (puzzle input)?
 
 ### Part 2
 
 - Boarding pass list missing items from front and back as these seats don't exist on this plane.
 - Occupied seats is continuous apart from where I'm sitting (ID+1 and -1 will be in my list).
 - Requirement: what is my seat ID?
 
 My thinking:
 - Seat ID is effectively seat number as `SeatID = row x 8 + col` where `8` is number of seats in row. This means it should be continuous, apart from a block at the start and end we are told is missing. We are also told our seat ±1 is occupied, so we are looking for unoccupied seats... turns out there is only 1 unoccupied seat, so this must be ours.
 
 
 
# Day 6: Custom Customs

- Customs declaration forms have 26 yes/no questions marked a-z.
- Identify any question a member of your group answers `yes`.
- Example group og three people might answer:

  - `abcx`
  - `abcy`
  - `abcz`
  
  In this example 6 questions were marked as yes: `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
  
- Puzzle input is every group on the plane's answers, where each person has their own line, and groups are separated by a blank line.
- Example:

  ```
  abc
  
  a
  b
  c
  
  ab
  ac
  
  a
  a
  a
  a
  
  b
  ```
  
  where:
  
  - The first group contains one person who answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
  - The second group contains three people; combined, they answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
  - The third group contains two people; combined, they answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
  - The fourth group contains four people; combined, they answered "yes" to only 1 question, a.
  - The last group contains one person who answered "yes" to only 1 question, b.
  - Sum of `yes` counts is `3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11`
  - Requirement: for each group count the number of questions to which someone answered yes to, and calculat the sum of those counts.



## Day 7

- Aviation regulations say bags must be colour coded and must contain specific number of other bags.
- Example rules are:

  - `light red` bags contain 1 `bright white` bag, 2 `muted yellow` bags.
  - `dark orange` bags contain 3 `bright white` bags, 4 `muted yellow` bags.
  - `bright white` bags contain 1 `shiny gold` bag.
  - `muted yellow` bags contain 2 `shiny gold` bags, 9 `faded blue` bags.
  - `shiny gold` bags contain 1 `dark olive` bag, 2 `vibrant plum` bags.
  - `dark olive` bags contain 3 `faded blue` bags, 4 `dotted black` bags.
  - `vibrant plum` bags contain 5 `faded blue` bags, 6 `dotted black` bags.
  - `faded blue` bags contain no other bags.
  - `dotted black` bags contain no other bags.
  
  In this example:
  
  - every `faded blue` bag is empty
  - every `vibrant plum` bag contains 11 bags (5 faded blue and 6 dotted black)

- You have a `shiny gold` bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one shiny gold bag?):
- In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:

  - A `bright white` bag, which can hold your `shiny gold` bag directly.
  - A `muted yellow` bag, which can hold your `shiny gold` bag directly, plus some other bags.
  - A `dark orange` bag, which can hold `bright white` and `muted yellow` bags, either of which could then hold your `shiny gold` bag.
  - A `light red` bag, which can hold `bright white` and `muted yellow` bags, either of which could then hold your `shiny gold` bag.

- So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one  shiny gold  bag is  4.
- Requirement: How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one `shiny gold` bag?



## Day 8

- Operation (`acc`, `jmp`, or `nop`) and an argument (a signed number like `+4` or `-20`).
- `acc` = accumulator that starts at zero. Argument increases / decreases by the given amount.
- `jmp` jumps to the instruction given by the argument, i.e. `jmp 2` would jump to the the line following the next line, whilst `jmp -1` would go to the proceeding line.
- `nop` is no operation, and the next line executes next.
- We know we are in an infinite loop when any instruction is run for a second time.
- Requirement: find the value in the accumulator before an instruction is run for a second time.


## Day 9

- Data encrypted with eXchange-Masking Addition System (XMAS)
- XMAS startes with a 25 number preamble
- After that each number should be the sum of any 2 numbers in the immediate 25 numbers
- Requirement: what is the first number that doesn't follow this rule in the supplied data?



## Day 17

- Conway Cubes
- The pocket dimension contains an infinite 3-dimensional grid.
- State at each point in grid either `active` or `inactive`.
- Initial state almost all points start `inactive` (`.`). Small number start as `active` (`#`).
- Energy source executes 6 cycles.
- Each cube only considers its neighbours, i.e. point `x=1,y=2,z=3` would consider amongst others `x=2,y=2,z=2` and `x=0,y=2,z=3`.
- During each cycle every cube itterates according to:
  - If a cube is active and exactly 2 or 3 of its neighbors are also active, the cube remains active. Otherwise, the cube becomes inactive.
  - If a cube is inactive but exactly 3 of its neighbors are active, the cube becomes active. Otherwise, the cube remains inactive.

Observations:

- Relevant space grows by 2 in x, y, and z direction each iteration.

### Part 2

- Now 4 spatial dimensions: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.
- Same rules of interaction, but interacts with nearest neighbours over 4 rather than 3 dimensions.
- Example in part 1 now produces 848 cubes left in active state after 6 iterations.
