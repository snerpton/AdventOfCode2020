# Advent of Code 2020

More information about Advent of Code can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020.

## My Aims for Advent of Code 2020

- Use .Net 5 / and latest versions of C#
- Use Visual Studio for Mac and Rider


## Project Notes

- Taking a break on a tropical island
- Island is cash only
- Local currency is 'Starfish', often abbreviated to 'stars'
- No currency exchanges deal in stars, so only way to obtain enough stars for deposit is to solve puzzles
- Need 50 stars to pay for room deposit in 25 days time
- Two puzzles per day, with each puzzle paying 1 star


## Day 1

- Elves need me to fix my 'expense report' (puzzle input) before leaving on vacation
- Requirement: need to find the two entries that sum to 2020, and then multiply them together. This number is what we are looking for.
- Example: in list:

  - 1721
  - 979
  - 366
  - 299
  - 675
  - 1456

  Answer would be 514579 as (1721 + 299) = 2020 and (1721 x 299) = 514579
  

## Day 2

- Password database corrupted
- List of password provided in following format:

  - 1-3 a: abcde
  - 1-3 b: cdefg
  - 2-9 c: ccccccccc
  
  where the row is made up of a password policy and password delimited my a `:` character. A policy of `1-3 a` indicates `a` must be used 1-3 times in the password. The first and last passwords are valid, but the second one isn't valid as `b` doesn't occur 1-3 times in `cdefg`.
  
 - Requirement: How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
 
 ### Part 2
 
 - Requirement: password policy of part 1 incorrect, numbers describe positions not occurrence count, such that:
   - `1-3 a: abcde` is valid: position 1 contains a and position 3 does not.
   - `1-3 b: cdefg` is invalid: neither position 1 nor position 3 contains b.
   - `2-9 c: ccccccccc` is invalid: both position 2 and position 9 contain c.
   
   Exactly one of these positions must contain the specified letter.
  
   
 ## Day 3
 
 - Puzzle input is a map of trees where `.` represents open space, and `#` represents a tree.
 - Trees grow on a grid pattern.
 - Pattern repeats horizontally.
 - Navigate from top-left to off bottom of map in a move right 3 places and down 1. In this way you navigate diagonally downward.
 - Aim of puzzle is to count the number of trees you stop on i.e. after the 3-right 1-down move.
 
 
 
 ## Day 4
 
 - Passprts have following fields:
   
   - byr (Birth Year)
   - iyr (Issue Year)
   - eyr (Expiration Year)
   - hgt (Height)
   - hcl (Hair Color)
   - ecl (Eye Color)
   - pid (Passport ID)
   - cid (Country ID)
   
 - North Pole Credentials are the same as a passport, but without the `cid` field.
 - Scanner processes passports in batch files (puzzle input).
 - Passport made up of `key:value` pairs separated by spaces or new lines. Passports are separated by new lines.
 - Example batch file:
   ```
   ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
   byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm
   
   iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
   hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929
   
   hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
   eyr:2024
   ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
   hgt:179cm
   
   hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
   iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in 
   ```
   where: 
   
   - passport 1 is valid as all fields are present
   - passport 2 is invalid as `hgt` field is missing
   - passport 3 is in valid as `cid` filed is missing
   - passport 4 is invalid as `cid` and `byr` fields missing.
   
 - As a one-off we should also treat the `cid` as optional, and hence allow North Pole Credentials to be used like a passport i.e passport 3 should be treated as apassport even though it is a North Pole Credential
 - Requirement: how many passports are valid there?
